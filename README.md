For this Full Stack course, I used Express HTML and JavaScript, while implementing SPA. The backend implemented a NoSQL MongoDB database for extra secure protection for keeping the files in the MongoDB database secure. JSON is different from Javascript, because JSON is an actual file that you need in order for your entire website to work. You will not be able to see the website without having the JSON files up and available. JSON are the files that are needed in backend process, that the users do not see, that are needed for the users to have a display screen. When I refactored the code in the backend with JSON, the appearance of the website changed on the frontend (what the user sees). Security is very important when making a Full Stack application. I was able to use Mongo DB, my host Powershell, MongoDB Compass, and DB Beaver, just to name a few, to help with testing and security. This course has given me the confidence to be a Full Stack Web Developer, as well as to be any other Coding/Technology Professional. My skills of the understanding and implementing the M.E.A.N. stack has really helped me in my professional career to succeed and to be more marketable as a Computer Scientist.
